# ðŸš€ **ISS Tracker**

This is a personal passion project inspired by my interest in **Astronomy**. I am using **Python** and **Flask** to create a webserver that fetches the current location of the **International Space Station (ISS)** and then plots it on the map. 

Eventually, I would like to be able to move into **Software Defined Radios** to listen to broadcasts from the ISS and also expand into other **Satellites**, but for now, it's just tracking the location of the ISS!
