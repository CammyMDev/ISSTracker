# ISS Tracker

This is a personal passion project inspired by my intreset in Astronomy. I am using Python and Flask to create a webserver that fetchs the current location of the International Space Station and then plots it on the map. Eventually I would like to be able to move into Software Defined Radio to be able to listen to broadcasts from the ISS and also expand into other Satalites, but for now it is just tracking the location of the ISS!
